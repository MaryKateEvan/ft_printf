# ft_printf

> The goal of this project was pretty straightforward. We had to recode `printf()`, in order to learn on the way how to handle a variable number of arguments.


The following **9 conversions** had to be implemented in the project:<br>
* `%c` Prints a single character.<br>
* `%s` Prints a string (as defined by the common C convention).<br>
* `%p` The void * pointer argument has to be printed in *hexadecimal* format.<br>
* `%d` Prints a decimal (base 10) number.<br>
* `%i` Prints an integer in base 10.<br>
* `%u` Prints an unsigned decimal (base 10) number.<br>
* `%x` Prints a number in hexadecimal (base 16) lowercase format.<br>
* `%X` Prints a number in hexadecimal (base 16) uppercase format.<br>
* `%%` Prints a percent sign.<br>
